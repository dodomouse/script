# script
some scripts

vim2ide: 
This script can help vim become an IDE, it support ctags, taglist, winmanager and omnicpp now. 
I just test it in centos because it use rpm to install ctags. If you want to use it in Debian or Ubuntu, you can install ctags by yourself.
Actually, this script just install zip files and copy some config files to the place. :)
